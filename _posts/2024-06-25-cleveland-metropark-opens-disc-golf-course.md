## Cleveland Metroparks Opens Disc Golf Course at Astorhurst

Cleveland Metroparks recently announced the opening of an exciting new disc golf course at Astorhurst Park, located within the Bedford Reservation. This marks the first disc golf course in the Metroparks system, providing an innovative outdoor activity for residents and visitors alike.

### Why It Matters

The newly established 18-hole course is free to the public and occupies the picturesque terrain of Walton Hills, adjacent to the scenic Cuyahoga Valley National Park, where the historic Astorhurst Country Club once stood. The transformation of this area highlights the Metroparks' commitment to enhancing recreational opportunities while restoring natural habitats.

### A Brief History

The Metroparks acquired the 127-acre golf course in 2017, with plans to rehabilitate the land and return it to its natural state. This initiative not only revitalizes the area but also opens up new avenues for outdoor enthusiasts to engage with nature and enjoy physical activity.

### Course Features

Designed in-house by Cleveland Metroparks, the disc golf course spans over 10,000 yards and includes three sets of tees catering to various skill levels: amateur, professional, and competition. This thoughtful design ensures that players of all abilities can enjoy a challenging and fun experience. The course is open daily during regular park hours, though players are required to bring their own discs.

### More Recreation Options

For those who prefer traditional golf, Cleveland Metroparks offers a total of nine golf courses, with two—Sleepy Hollow and Manakiki—ranked among the best in the region. This diversity in recreational options solidifies Cleveland Metroparks as a key destination for outdoor activities.
