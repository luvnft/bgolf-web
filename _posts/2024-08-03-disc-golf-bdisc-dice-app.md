The course at Disc Road can get a bit monotonous over time. On YouTube and social media, you may have come across the Disc Golf Dice Game, which aims to add some excitement to your training.

Weâ€™ve developed a digital version that runs in your smartphone browser. [You can try it out here](/disc-dice).

The dice determine which disc-throw combination you must use from the tee. Hyzer putter? Anhyzer driver? Many unusual combinations are possible, encouraging you to experiment with new throws.

By the way: With the Joker, you can choose a disc or a throw!
