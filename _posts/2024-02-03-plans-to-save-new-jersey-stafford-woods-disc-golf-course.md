A plan to save the popular Stafford Woods disc-golf course in Voorhees has been submitted to state agencies by Voorhees Township. This proposal aims to modify the course's construction to align more closely with New Jersey regulations.

The origins of disc golf have sparked debate, but its rise to popularity began in the 1960s with the widespread use of the Frisbee disc. The sport was formalized in 1977 when Frisbee inventor Edward E. Headrick and his son Kenneth A. Headrick received a patent for a "flying disc entrapment device," the design of which closely resembles the baskets used in disc golf today. Modern discs have evolved beyond the traditional Frisbee, now featuring specialized "drivers" and "putters," often color-coded for different uses.

Stephen J. Steglik, the Voorhees Township administrator, recently shared with 70and73.com that the proposal was developed in collaboration with disc-golf community leaders, Bill Green (owner of the nearby Saddlehill Winery), and state Assembly representatives Louis D. Greenwald and Pamela R. Lampitt. Environmental Resolutions Inc., an engineering firm, prepared the plan for the Township.

An inspection of Stafford Woods, designated as a protected park, resulted in a warning from the state that the disc-golf course was not a permitted use on certain parts of the property and needed to be removed. The state classified the sport as not meeting the criteria for "passive recreation." Failure to address this issue could jeopardize the Township's eligibility for future funding from the state conservation program, as highlighted in a letter dated April 4, signed by David E. Zimmer and Patricia Gardner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

The counterproposal submitted by the Township on June 20 must receive approval from state agencies before becoming final, according to Steglik.

Environmental Resolutions Inc. worked alongside disc-golf community members to inspect the course and evaluate its impact. A significant concern was the number of trees cleared by volunteers during course construction. The proposal identified 90 removed trees that need replacingâ€”64 were dead, while 26 were alive.

To address environmental concerns, the Township plans to plant 50 trees along the property line to restore the tree line and establish a buffer. In addition, signs will be erected to designate the area as a "No Clearing Zone," as requested by the state.

Measures to mitigate damage to tree bark from stray discs include protective burlap wraps on trees near the fairways. The eight-page plan also calls for the removal of impervious surfaces, such as pavement installed during the original course construction. The first nine holes opened in 2012, and the course was expanded to 18 holes by volunteers in 2014.

The golf baskets will be re-anchored with screw-type augers instead of concrete, and stone seating walls will be replaced with natural seating made from dead, fallen trees. Permeable tee boxes will replace existing pavers at each tee, and amenities such as portable toilets, picnic areas, and a storage container will be relocated from the protected land to the gravel parking lot.

To clarify the boundaries of the disc-golf course and the original Stafford Walking Trail, which is specified in the property's deed, the Township proposes further delineation. The walking trail intersects several sections of the disc-golf course.

Another issue the Township seeks to address is soil compaction caused by foot traffic. To mitigate this, wood chips will be spread along paths to reduce compaction and define the golf course more clearly. Dead trees will be strategically placed on the outer edges of the fairways to mark boundaries and guide walkers.

The Stafford Woods course, which hosts around 20 tournaments annually, is known as one of the top disc-golf courses in New Jersey. In response to its popularity, the Township plans to limit the number of tournaments to eight per year. They are also considering the formation of a Township-sponsored Disc Golf Association to regulate larger events.

Overall, the Township's proposal aims to ensure the future of the Stafford Woods disc-golf course while complying with state regulations and preserving the park's natural environment. The growing popularity of disc golf, coupled with the passionate community surrounding it, has sparked a petition that has garnered over 25,000 signatures in support of the course.

In 2021, the 248-year-old Stafford Farm was sold to Green's Saddlehill Winery for $900,000, preserving the remaining land for agricultural use and saving Stafford Woods as open space. As one disc golfer stated in a five-star review on the UDisc site, "This place was made to enjoy the game of disc golf. The town better not touch it in any way."
