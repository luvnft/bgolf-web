# Preparing for Your Upcoming Tournament: Essential Gear and Tips

As your next tournament approaches, do you find yourself questioning whether you've packed all the essentials? While it’s a given to include items like discs, markers, and your smartphone, we want to highlight some insider tips that can enhance your tournament experience, making it not just more comfortable, but potentially more successful. Here’s a rundown of often-overlooked items that can be invaluable during your event!

## 1. Multiple Towels
Packing a few towels instead of just one can make a significant difference. The weather can be unpredictable! Bring a towel for drying off wet discs, one to wipe off sweat, and perhaps an extra in case of unexpected rain. Keeping your discs dry can lead to more accurate throws. Plus, a quick spritz of disinfectant spray can keep your hands clean after snacking.

## 2. Rain Gear: Umbrella and Jacket
Regardless of how favorable the weather forecast looks, it’s wise to bring a rain jacket. Lightweight and compact options are best since they won't take up much space. If rain is on the horizon, consider packing an umbrella as well. You can find larger umbrellas at golf shops that will keep you and your gear dry.

## 3. Hydration and Snacks
While it seems straightforward, the type of snacks you choose can significantly impact your performance. Opt for energy-boosting options that won’t weigh you down, like nuts, energy bars, or fruits such as apples and bananas. Don’t forget to pack plenty of water—especially on hot days, it's better to have an extra bottle than not enough. Avoid sticky snacks to keep your hands clean.

## 4. Spare Socks
Believe it or not, a fresh pair of socks can be a game changer during a long tournament. Wet or sandy socks can be uncomfortable and distract you from your game.

## 5. Compact First Aid Kit
A small first aid kit with a few band-aids, some disinfectant spray, and pain-relief ointment can be lifesavers. Accidents can happen quickly during play, so being prepared is always a smart move.

## 6. Writing Tools
Carrying a waterproof notepad and a pen that writes in wet conditions can be quite helpful. Jotting down notes about your throws or the courses can aid your development and strategy for future games.

## 7. Extra Discs
You may have your favorite discs, but what if one goes missing? Bringing a couple of backup discs can alleviate stress, especially on unfamiliar courses where losing a disc is a possibility.

## 8. Sunscreen and Bug Spray
Often overlooked, sunscreen and insect repellent are crucial. A sunburn or persistent bug bites can spoil your day and negatively affect your performance. Remember to apply sunscreen with the hand you don’t throw with to avoid slippery grips.

## 9. Sandpaper for Disc Care
A handy tip for disc golf players is to carry sandpaper. Small nicks and rough patches can occur on your discs during gameplay, impacting their feel and performance. A bit of sandpaper can help smooth these imperfections and keep your discs in optimal condition. A small piece takes up almost no space in your bag.

## 10. Sunglasses: More Than Just Style
Good sunglasses are essential for protecting your eyes during long, sunny tournament days. They reduce glare, which can improve the accuracy of your throws and prevent eye fatigue caused by squinting in bright sunlight. Opt for sunglasses with UV protection to ensure clear visibility on the course.

## 11. Power Bank: Stay Charged
A long tournament can drain your smartphone, particularly if you’re using it for scorekeeping or GPS navigation. Keeping a power bank handy ensures you won’t lose track of scores due to a dead battery. It’s also great for those moments when you want to relax with music or share the latest memes during breaks.

## Conclusion
Armed with these tips, you’ll be ready for virtually any situation that arises during your disc golf tournament. So, pack your bag, grab your discs, and get ready to compete! Best of luck and, more importantly, have fun!
