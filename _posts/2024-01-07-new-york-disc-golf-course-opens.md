As we leave 2022 behind, we also reflect on the first four months of our weekly league, "Syndication Weekly." Since August, we have played 197 rounds with 44 players participating. Over 20 events saw a peak attendance of 21 disc golfers, who collectively threw over 5,000 times at the course in Cologne.

You can find the current results and more [statistics on UDisc](https://udisc.com/leagues/syndication-weekly/1-Jan-ECG8?tab=standings).

The event has established itself well, and we are excited to continue into the new year. During the colder months, we will keep our Sunday meetings at 1 PM, but as the days grow longer, weâ€™ll transition back to our Tuesday evening slots.

We warmly welcome beginners to join us and gain their first "tournament experiences" in a friendly atmosphere.

On another note, the disc golf scene is expanding rapidly across the United States, with significant developments like the opening of New York City's first disc golf course in Highland Park on June 14. This 10-hole course features various elevation changes and tree placements, making it both accessible for newcomers and challenging for seasoned players. The course's launch is thanks to the New York City Disc Golf Association, co-founded by Alex Bender and Alex Hoyle, who discovered the sport while biking in Prospect Park.

Their serendipitous meeting sparked a movement that has already grown from a small Facebook group to a community of over 300 enthusiasts. With plans to establish disc golf courses in all five boroughs, the NYCDGA is poised to bring this engaging sport to a wider audience.

Disc golf is not just a sport; it's a community that brings people together. As we look ahead, we encourage your feedback on our league and the emerging disc golf landscape. How did you enjoy the first events, and what can be improved? Feel free to [email us at hi@bclub.golf](mailto:hi@bclub.golf).
