## What You Need to Know

- The new disc golf course at UW-Green Bay opened on August 17, 2024.
- It features both long and short tees to accommodate various skill levels.
- The university shut down its original golf course in 2021 due to resource constraints.
- Funding for the new course came from the UW-Green Bay Student Government Association and the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay Foundations.

The University of Wisconsin-Green Bay has made an exciting transformation, turning a traditional golf course into an 18-hole disc golf course designed by renowned designer and pro Cale Leiviska. Shawn Bolchen, an avid disc golfer with over 25 years of experience, praised the new Shorewood Disc Golf Course as one of the best he has encountered.

“It’s a super fun track to play. It’s challenging,” Bolchen noted. He believes that once the short tees are installed, the course will attract a wider range of players and become a valuable asset to the local disc golf community.

Bolchen highlighted the advantages of the course's previous life as a traditional golf course, stating, “Having a top pro design the course makes it even better.” He compared it favorably to other local courses, noting, “The next best course after this one in Green Bay is Pamperin Park,” but emphasized that Shorewood offers more space to maneuver.

His wife, Sonja Bolchen, who enjoys playing alongside her family, added, “It’s great, and I think everyone else will do it. It’s going to get so much more use in this park now. That’s a beautiful green space for young and old.”

Shawn also sees the course as a promotional opportunity for the region, suggesting it could attract younger players who are interested in disc golf. “This would be a reason to come here,” he stated.

Since the course opened, the Bolchen family has played multiple rounds, embracing the change and excited about the potential it brings to the community.
