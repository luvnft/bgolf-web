* Forgetting your Bag Tag results in a $2 donation to the club’s fund.
* The lower-numbered Bag Tag determines the challenge round.
* If Bag Tag holders are playing in a tournament or a weekly event in the same group, they automatically compete for each other’s tags.
* Cross-group challenges are only permitted with prior agreement. In case of a tie, the lower number wins!
